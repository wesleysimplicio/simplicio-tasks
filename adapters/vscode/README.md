# VS Code (Copilot) adapter

GitHub Copilot in VS Code reads `.github/copilot-instructions.md` as repo-wide custom
instructions, supports **MCP servers**, and can run **tasks**. We use all three.

## Install

```bash
bash scripts/install.sh vscode
```

The installer writes `.github/copilot-instructions.md` that loads the orchestrator protocol
(it references `.claude/skills/simplicio-tasks/SKILL.md` and the satellites) and registers the
MCP server in `.vscode/mcp.json`.

## Loop drive — self-paced via tasks

Copilot has no stop-hook. Drive the loop with a VS Code task that re-invokes the agent, or run
`simplicio-loop` self-paced. Minimal `.vscode/tasks.json` tick:

```jsonc
{ "version": "2.0.0", "tasks": [
  { "label": "simplicio-loop tick", "type": "shell",
    "command": "python3 hooks/loop_stop.py < NUL" } ]
}
```

(The agent itself does the work each turn; the task only advances the scratchpad when running
headless. In interactive chat, just keep saying "continue" — the protocol is idempotent.)

## Token economy

`orient_clamp.py` works as-is in the integrated terminal. Reference it in
`copilot-instructions.md` so Copilot routes heavy commands through it.

## Native bind — MCP (REQUIRED)

`simplicio-runtime` native bind is REQUIRED on VS Code/Copilot, not optional. `simplicio
install --global` (run automatically by `scripts/install.sh vscode`) writes `.vscode/mcp.json`:

```json
{ "servers": { "simplicio": { "command": "simplicio", "args": ["serve", "--mcp", "--stdio"] } } }
```

Then the extension points bind to `simplicio-runtime` natively. Verify with `simplicio doctor
--json` before relying on the orchestrator.

## Use

Open Copilot Chat and type: `/simplicio-tasks finish all the open issues` (or paste the goal —
the instructions file makes Copilot follow the protocol).
