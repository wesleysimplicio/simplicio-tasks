## ⚡ TL;DR

**simplicio-tasks** is a runtime-agnostic **super-plugin** — one autonomous looping
orchestrator (invoked as **`/simplicio-tasks`**) plus **five satellite skills** — that turns any
strong LLM (Claude, Codex, Copilot, Gemini, Cursor, local models) into a self-driving worker. You
point it at a body of work — *"finish all the open issues"*, *"clear the CI queue"*, *"drain the Jira board"* — and it
runs the whole lifecycle on its own:

> **discover → understand → decide → act → verify → correct → record → repeat**

It discovers work from any source (GitHub Issues, Jira, Azure DevOps, agentsview sessions, and
more), dedups, auto-scales an agent fleet to your machine, implements each item through a quality
loop that **runs the code (not just compiles it)**, opens PRs, resolves CI/review feedback, merges,
and keeps watching **24/7** for new work — all behind safety gates and a hard cost kill-switch.

```text
/simplicio-tasks finish all open issues
→ identity + pre-flight (kill-switch, auth, watcher)
→ discover 50 issues · dedup · build dependency DAG
→ autoscale fleet = 14 · pipeline implement→review→merge
→ each item: read body+ACs → orient code → plan → edit → run → verify → PR
→ merge · close with evidence · rollback if main breaks
→ keep looping every ~2 min until the queue is dry (evidence-gated, never a false "done")
```

Three things make it different: it is a **super-plugin of focused skills**, it runs the **same
protocol on 11 runtimes**, and it does all of this with **aggressive, honest token economy**.

Within the Simplicio product line, this repo is also the **current reference task flow** for
company work. `simplicio-runtime` is the unified entrypoint going forward, but it is expected to
reuse this loop's evidence-gated converge/drain discipline, durable attempt journal, and worker
coordination patterns instead of creating a separate task semantics.

## 📘 Official capability record

The complete, official roster of what `simplicio-tasks` ships — every capability below is **real,
runnable, and tested** (`python3 scripts/check.py`: claims-audit 5/5 + local test suite). Each links to its
deep section and its worker.

| Capability | What it does | Proof / worker | Details |
|---|---|---|---|
| 🎬 **Video evidence** (`video_evidence`) | Records the **real browser session** as moving proof a UI change works (Playwright, default); renders a **deterministic captioned MP4** with [hyperframes](https://github.com/heygen-com/hyperframes) for an explicit explainer request (`/simplicio-tasks make a video of screen X`) | `scripts/video_evidence.py` · BLOCKED (never fake-pass) without the toolchain | [§ Video evidence](#-video-evidence--playwright-by-default-hyperframes-on-request) |
| 🧠 **Attempt memory + stall detector** | A durable run-journal (`.orchestrator/loop/journal.jsonl`) + a stall detector so the loop **changes strategy instead of oscillating**; incremental triage (`since`) reads only the delta each turn, and optional stage lineage makes retries/governance explicit | `scripts/loop_journal.py` · `selftest` 13/13 | [§ Anti-oscillation](#-attempt-memory--stall-detector-anti-oscillation) |
| 🧭 **Repo conventions** (`repo_conventions`) | **Learns the repo's own playbook** — mines git history + merged PRs + static config into `.orchestrator/conventions.json` so every new branch/commit/PR mirrors the team's established style; worktree-per-item isolation is the default | `scripts/repo_conventions.py` · `selftest` 19/19 | [§ The full flow](#️-the-full-flow--from-demand-to-delivery) |
| 🧩 **Scope reflection** (`dependency_graph`) | Maps local dependencies, reverse dependents, and related tests from the planned touched files; blocks task plans that ignore callers, sibling files, or proof points before the edit starts | `scripts/impact_audit.py` · `selftest` | [§ Tests & local checks](#-tests--local-checks-no-paid-ci) |
| 🕸️ **Flow coverage** (`endpoint_compare`) | Maps mixed front/back/service workspaces: UI actions → frontend HTTP calls → backend endpoints → service calls; blocks frontend calls with no backend endpoint and stubbed endpoints, and surfaces unclassified loose ends | `scripts/flow_audit.py` · `selftest` | [§ Tests & local checks](#-tests--local-checks-no-paid-ci) |
| 🔒 **Fail-closed safety gate** (`action_gate`) | A `PreToolUse`/git-pre-push hook that **mechanically blocks** force-push, history rewrite, mass-delete, destructive DDL, infra teardown, and secret-laden commits/pushes — Step 5 made executable, not prose | `hooks/action_gate.py` · `selftest` 15/15 | [§ Safety](#-safety-non-negotiable) |
| 🔬 **Local verification** | A test suite (worker selftests + an **e2e of the loop driver** proving evidence-gated exit) + a **claims-audit** (referenced scripts exist · counts consistent · `_bundle ≡ source`) — all local, **no paid CI** | `scripts/check.py` · `scripts/claims_audit.py` · `tests/` | [§ Tests & local checks](#-tests--local-checks-no-paid-ci) |
| ✅ **Honest savings** | The savings line is now **evidence-gated, not mandatory** — a number is shown only with a measured receipt (clamp/signatures/cache/`deterministic_edit`/ledger); never fabricated | token-economy contract | [§ Token economy](#-token-economy) |

Two loop **modes** make termination explicit: **converge** (a single hard task — ends on the
evidence-gated `<promise>` or a stall escalation) vs **drain** (a queue — ends when the source
re-query stays empty K rounds). Both still obey the universal exits (promise+evidence,
`max_iterations`, budget, STOP).

> Loop scoring across this line of work: **7.5** (strong design, unproven) → **9** (attempt memory +
> anti-oscillation) → **9.5** (reproducible local proof) → **~10** (enforced safety + complete loop
> semantics). The verification infra now catches the project's own regressions as it grows.

## 🧠 The 11 skills & accelerators

The orchestrator core + five satellites + five accelerators/integrations. Each satellite is
**optional** — when loaded, the orchestrator delegates to it (richer + cheaper); when absent, the
inline protocol covers 100%. Accelerators are **auto-detected** — present = used, absent = LLM
fallback.

| # | Capability | Absorbs | What it does | Token impact |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| 1 | 🔁 **simplicio-tasks** | — | The orchestrator loop: 48 extension points, dual-path router, self-audit convergence | Core |
| 2 | ♾️ **simplicio-loop** | [ralph-loop](https://github.com/cursor/plugins/tree/main/ralph-loop) | Hardened Ralph loop: evidence-gated `<promise>` exit, max_iterations cap | Loop drive |
| 3 | 🧱 **simplicio-orient** | [rtk](https://github.com/rtk-ai/rtk) + [caveman](https://github.com/JuliusBrussee/caveman) | Terminal-first execution, output-reduction catalog, tee-cache, signatures-read | L0 deterministic |
| 4 | 🔥 **simplicio-review** | [thermos](https://github.com/cursor/plugins/tree/main/thermos) | Parallel adversarial review on distinct rubrics → deduped verdict | Quality gate |

| 8 | 📊 **agentsview** | [kenn-io](https://github.com/kenn-io/agentsview) | Session analytics, cost tracking, stalled-session discovery | **L1** SQL only |
| 9 | ⚡ **LMCache** | [LMCache](https://github.com/LMCache/LMCache) | KV cache between loop turns — 40-70% TTFT reduction on local models | GPU time ↓ |
| 10 | 🗜️ **Simplicio capture engine** | `engine/simplicio_engine.py` (native, stdlib-only) | Transparent capture proxy: forwards to the real provider, measures + deterministically compresses, writes `proxy_savings.json` | **deterministic** |
| 11 | 🎬 **video_evidence** | Playwright (default) · [hyperframes](https://github.com/heygen-com/hyperframes) (on request) | Records the **real session** as moving proof of a UI change (Playwright); renders a **deterministic captioned MP4** explainer with hyperframes when the video IS the deliverable | Evidence producer |

Each skill lives under [`.claude/skills/`](.claude/skills); each accelerator has a reference doc
under `.claude/skills/simplicio-tasks/references/` (the video producer:
[`video-evidence.md`](.claude/skills/simplicio-tasks/references/video-evidence.md), worker
[`scripts/video_evidence.py`](scripts/video_evidence.py)).

---

## 📡 Source adapters

The orchestrator discovers work from any source via pluggable adapters. Each exposes six verbs:
`list_ready`, `get_details`, `claim`, `update_status`, `attach_evidence`, `close`.

| Source | Adapter | Purpose |
|---|---|---|
| GitHub Issues/PRs | `gh` CLI (native) | Primary work-item source |
| Jira / Asana / ClickUp / Linear / Notion | host connector | Board/project management |
| Trello / Azure DevOps | `az boards` adapter | Azure work tracking |
| **agentsview sessions** | `scripts/agentsview_adapter.py` | Stalled session recovery + cost observability |
| Local files / CI queue | filesystem / CI API | Internal work tracking |

See each adapter's reference doc under `.claude/skills/simplicio-tasks/references/`.

---

## 🌐 11 runtimes, one protocol

One universal skill core + one set of hooks drives every runtime. An adapter is thin: it tells a
runtime *where to load the skills*, *how to arm the loop*, and *how to bind native speed*. **The
skill names no runtime; the runtime detects the skill.**

| Runtime | Skill load | Loop drive | Native bind |
|---|---|---|---|
| **Claude Code** | `.claude/skills/` + plugin | `Stop` hook | MCP |
| **Codex** | `AGENTS.md` | self-paced | MCP / adapter |
| **VS Code (Copilot)** | `copilot-instructions.md` | tasks | MCP |
| **Cursor** | `.cursor-plugin/` | `stop`+`afterAgentResponse` | MCP / rules |
| **Antigravity** | rules / `AGENTS.md` | self-paced | MCP |
| **Kiro** | `.kiro/steering/` | specs | MCP |
| **OpenCode** | `AGENTS.md` | self-paced | MCP |
| **Gemini** | `GEMINI.md` | self-paced | MCP / adapter |
| **Aider** | `CONVENTIONS.md` | self-paced | — (LLM fallback) |
| **Hermes** | native recall | native loop | **native** |
| **OpenClaw** | plugin SDK | native scheduler | **native** |

The promise: **same protocol, same gates, same safety on all 11 — only the speed differs.**
`orient_clamp.py` (token economy) works on every runtime with zero wiring. See
[`adapters/MATRIX.md`](adapters/MATRIX.md).

## 🗺️ The full flow — from demand to delivery

Every layer the orchestrator acts on, in order — from reading the demand (issues, tasks, assigns)

## 🔁 The loop

The **Evidence-Gated Loop** is the core mechanism. It re-feeds the same goal each turn so the
agent sees its own prior work. Exit is ONLY via:

1. **Evidence-gated `<promise>`** — the turn that emits the promise MUST also carry concrete
   proof (passing test, merged PR, closed-item re-query). A promise with no evidence = ignored.
2. **`max_iterations` cap** — hard safety backstop
3. **Budget kill-switch** — `daily_usd_ceiling` halts the loop when spent
4. **STOP signal** — `.orchestrator/STOP` or channel command

Between turns, LMCache (when available) caches the KV state so re-feed costs near-zero prefill.

### 🧠 Attempt memory + stall detector (anti-oscillation)

A re-feed loop that remembers nothing oscillates — try X, fail, try X again — until the cap burns.
simplicio-loop keeps a **durable run-journal** (`.orchestrator/loop/journal.jsonl`, append-only:
`iteration · action · hypothesis · gate · error-fingerprint`, plus optional lineage like
`execution_state · stage_id · validator · decision · retry_count`) and a **stall detector**
([`scripts/loop_journal.py`](scripts/loop_journal.py), deterministic + model-free):

- **Error fingerprint** — the failing gate output is reduced to a stable hash with line numbers,
  paths, hex/uuids, timestamps and durations normalized away, so the *same* bug is recognized
  across turns even when the incidental text differs.
- **Stall = K identical-fingerprint failures in a row** (default K=3). A changing fingerprint means
  the loop is moving (PROGRESS); the same one K times means it is spinning (STALLED).
- On STALLED the loop does **not** re-feed the same goal — it names the **dead-end actions** to
  avoid, then **switches strategy** or **escalates to the human gate** with the fingerprint.
- `loop_journal.py resume` is read at the top of every turn, so a fresh process continues without
  re-deriving prior attempts (real resume) and never retries a known dead-end.
- When the loop is doing extraction, validation, or governed retries, `record` can also stamp
  `--execution-state`, `--stage-id`, `--source-artifact`, `--chunk-id`, `--validator`,
  `--decision`, `--retry-count`, `--blocked-reason`, and `--next-action`, so the next turn knows
  not just *what* failed, but *where in the flow* it failed.

```bash
loop_journal.py resume                       # what was tried + dead-ends to avoid
loop_journal.py record --iteration N --action "…" --gate fail --gate-output test.log \
  --execution-state planned --stage-id validate --validator pytest --decision retry
loop_journal.py stall --k 3 --exit-code      # PROGRESS → re-feed · STALLED → switch/escalate
```

---

## 🎬 Video evidence — Playwright by default, hyperframes on request

The loop produces **demo videos** as proof a change works — **two engines**, one `video_evidence`
extension point (worker [`scripts/video_evidence.py`](scripts/video_evidence.py), contract
[`references/video-evidence.md`](.claude/skills/simplicio-tasks/references/video-evidence.md)):

1. **Default — the normal evidence flow uses Playwright.** After a UI change, `video_evidence`
   records the **real browser session** driving the screen (Playwright native video → `.webm`, →
   `.mp4` with FFmpeg) — the strongest "works, not just compiles" receipt (Step 4b) and a valid
   evidence-gated `<promise>`.

   ```bash
   python3 scripts/video_evidence.py verify --url http://localhost:3000/login \
       --name login-demo --expect "Sign in" --issue 42 [--upload --pr 42]
   ```

2. **On request — a personalized explainer uses hyperframes.** When the deliverable IS a video
   ("make an explainer video of screen X"), the orchestrator renders a **deterministic, captioned
   slideshow** of the `web_verify` screenshots with
   [**hyperframes**](https://github.com/heygen-com/hyperframes) (by HeyGen — "same input, same
   frames, same output", CI-reproducible, no API keys, local render via headless Chrome + FFmpeg).

   ```text
   /simplicio-tasks make an explainer video of the system login screen
   → detect: video-creation request → web_verify captures the screens
   → video_evidence verify --engine hyperframes → deterministic MP4 → attached to the PR
   ```

Either engine: a video that never recorded/rendered yields **BLOCKED**, never a fake pass. Evidence
is always a **file path + boolean verdict** — never video bytes in context (token economy).

---

## 📊 Token economy

| Technique | Savings |
|---|---|
| `deterministic_edit` (L0) | 100% of edit tokens (file written mechanically, never by LLM) |
| Terminal-first execution | Facts from shell, not LLM hallucination |
| Output-reduction catalog | Caps per command type (`CAP_ERRORS=20`, `CAP_WARNINGS=10`, `CAP_LIST=20`) — `orient_clamp.py` |
| Tee+CCR cache on failure | Never re-run a failed command — read the cached output |
| Signatures-only reads | `simplicio-cli signatures <file>` — 870-line file → 65 lines (**93% saved**), bodies stripped |
| `simplicio-compress` | Terse prose + one-time memory compaction |
| `orient_clamp.py` | Clamp + tee on every shell command, zero wiring |
| Native response cache | repeated deterministic (temp=0) request → served from cache, skips the LLM call (**100% on hit**) — `simplicio-cli cache`, on by default (`SIMPLICIO_CACHE=0` to disable) |
| Simplicio capture proxy + MCP | 60-95% fewer tokens on tool outputs via a transparent compression daemon |

Savings only count on a verified-correct outcome. Baseline = the cheapest sensible non-orchestrated
path to the same result. **Savings reporting is evidence-gated, not mandatory:** a savings figure is
shown only when a turn actually ran an economy-producing command and the number traces to a
measured receipt (clamp tee, signatures-read, cache hit, `deterministic_edit`, `savings_ledger`).
No measured economy → no savings line; the orchestrator never fabricates a baseline or a percentage.
See `references/token-economy.md`.

### 🔎 Running `simplicio-tasks`: economy vs measurement (per runtime)

Two different things happen when you call **`simplicio-tasks`**, and they behave differently per runtime:

- **Economy** — compression, output clamps, signatures-only reads, `deterministic_edit` — applies **every
  time the skill runs and loads `simplicio-orient` / `simplicio-compress`, on any runtime.** It is the
  skill's behavior plus the hooks (strongest where hooks exist: `orient_clamp.py` auto-clamps on Claude and
  Cursor; elsewhere it is instruction-driven).
- **Measurement** — the Token Monitor's live numbers — only counts traffic that flows **through the
  capture proxy.**

| Runtime | Economy (skill) | Measurement (monitor) |
|---|---|---|
| **Hermes** | ✓ | ✓ **automatic** — already routed through the proxy (`base_url → :8788`) |
| **Claude** | ✓ (skill + hooks) | ✗ by default — Claude talks to `api.anthropic.com` directly; measured only once routed (`simplicio-cli wrap claude`, or `ANTHROPIC_BASE_URL → http://127.0.0.1:8788`) |
| **Codex** | ✓ (skill) | ✗ by default — `simplicio-cli init codex` adds the MCP tools but does not route LLM traffic; measured with `simplicio-cli wrap codex` or an OpenAI base-url pointing at the proxy |

So: the **savings happen on every runtime**; the **monitor tallies them automatically on Hermes**, and on
Claude/Codex after a **one-time routing step** (`simplicio-cli wrap …` / base-url → `:8788`). Without routing,
the economy still applies — the monitor just won't count those tokens. `scripts/simplicio-economy.sh wire`
does this routing for OpenAI-compatible clients at install time.

### 📈 Simplicio Token Monitor

A view of the savings you open when you want — only the capture is always-on:

- **Capture proxy** — **always-on** (the one auto-started service; the wired clients need it
  reachable). It silently captures + measures Claude + Codex + Hermes in the background.
- **Web dashboard** — `http://127.0.0.1:9090` — real-time token chart, savings gauge, the LLMs/runtimes
  and **141/144 providers (98%)** we intercept, a live proxy log. **Opens once on the first install**
  so you see it works, then it's **on-demand** — re-open it any of these ways:
  - `simplicio-loop dashboard` — works from anywhere after the pip install (no repo path needed);
    `simplicio-loop dashboard --stop` to close, `--no-browser` to just start the server.
  - `bash scripts/simplicio-economy.sh monitor` (repo checkout) · `… monitor stop` to close.
  - just **ask the agent** — "open the token dashboard".
- **Menu-bar / tray widget** — live tokens saved in the system tray (macOS rumps · Windows/Linux pystray).
  **On-demand:** `bash scripts/simplicio-economy.sh tray` · `… tray stop`.

Install auto-starts **only the capture proxy** (macOS launchd · Linux systemd · Windows Startup). The
dashboard opens **once** on a fresh install (marker-guarded — a re-install/update never reopens it; opt
out with `SIMPLICIO_NO_DASHBOARD=1`), and the tray never opens by itself — nothing is forced to stay
open. Manage the stack: `scripts/simplicio-economy.sh {status|up|monitor|tray|wire}`. After install,
capture runs **without invoking the loop** — see `references/token-capture.md`.

### 🛠️ The capture engine — one native module, every command

[`engine/simplicio_engine.py`](engine/simplicio_engine.py) is the native Simplicio capture engine
(stdlib-only, fail-open) — a **native, transparent capture proxy + deterministic compression engine
with no external dependency**. Run any
command via the [`scripts/simplicio-engine`](scripts/simplicio-engine) wrapper (e.g. `simplicio-engine doctor`):

| Command | What it does |
|---|---|
| `proxy` | the transparent capture proxy — routes each model to its **real** provider, compresses + measures + caches (no model swap) |
| `doctor` | proxy reachability + lifetime savings |
| `cache` | native response cache (`stats`/`clear`) — a repeated deterministic request is served from cache, skipping the LLM call |
| `signatures` | signatures-only view of a source file (bodies stripped, ~93% fewer tokens to read code) |
| `semantic` | reversible extractive (semantic-lite) compression |
| `detect` | content-type detection + smart per-block routing |
| `rag` | TF-IDF (or `--ml` embedding) retrieval over the CCR memory store |
| `memory` | CCR compress-cache-retrieve store (`remember`/`recall`/`forget`/`list`/`stats`) |
| `mcp` | native stdio MCP server (compress / retrieve / stats tools) |
| `init` / `wrap` | register Simplicio into a client (Claude / Codex / Copilot / OpenClaw) · run a client with capture routing |
| `report` / `audit` / `capture` / `evals` | savings report · audit a tree for compression opportunity · dry-run a request · compression regression gate |

## 🏛️ Design pillars (in detail)

Four mechanisms sustain the orchestration power:

| Pillar | Focus | Lives in |
|---|---|---|
| **DAG + pipeline** | parallelism by dependency, staged per item | `references/orchestration.md` (Step 3 pool + pipeline) |
| **Isolation by worktree** | parallel edits without corrupting the tree, merge-gated | `references/orchestration.md` |
| **Adversarial verify** | panel of skeptics before "delivered" | `references/quality-safety-delivery.md` · skill `simplicio-review` |
| **Loop budget cap** | anti-infinite-loop, dual exit | `references/standing-loop-247.md` · skill `simplicio-loop` |

## 🚀 Install & use

```bash
git clone https://github.com/wesleysimplicio/simplicio-loop
cd simplicio-loop

# install for your runtime (omit <runtime> to auto-detect)
bash scripts/install.sh <runtime> [--global] [--minimal]        # macOS / Linux
pwsh scripts/install.ps1 <runtime> [-Global]                    # Windows
# <runtime> ∈ claude codex vscode cursor antigravity kiro opencode gemini aider hermes openclaw
```

**Install is complete by default — it installs everything.** One command sets up the whole stack:
the two loop operators (`simplicio-mapper` + `simplicio-cli`, auto-handling PEP 668 / externally-managed
Python and symlinking the binaries onto `PATH`), the **full Python stack** (the package itself),
the **6 skills + hooks** with the loop's Stop hook wired, and the **always-on capture proxy**
with Claude + Codex + Hermes **routed and measured** in the background. The **dashboard opens once** on a
fresh install, then it's on-demand (`simplicio-loop dashboard` / `simplicio-economy.sh monitor`); the
**menu-bar tray never opens by itself** — nothing is forced to stay open.
Pass **`--minimal`** only for headless/CI to skip the heavy deps + the machine services. Verify any time:
`bash scripts/simplicio-economy.sh status`.

### Update

```bash
bash scripts/update.sh [<runtime>]    # git pull → reinstall skills/hooks/operators → restart services
```

`update.sh` stashes local edits, fast-forwards `main`, reinstalls from the fresh source, restarts the
launchd/systemd services so they run the new code, and prints the live stack + savings.

### Doctor — verify + repair

```bash
python3 scripts/doctor.py            # report the whole stack (REQUIRED vs OPTIONAL)
python3 scripts/doctor.py --repair   # install/wire what's fixable; make everything operational
# also: bash scripts/simplicio-economy.sh doctor [--repair]
```

`doctor` separates **REQUIRED** (python3, the two loop operators, the 6 skills, the loop hooks, the
capture proxy — `--repair` installs/wires them) from **OPTIONAL** accelerators (the tray dep).
**Missing an optional piece is never a failure and
never blocks** — the Python engine + the deterministic path cover everything; the exit code is 0 as
long as every REQUIRED item is healthy.

Or, on Claude Code / Cursor, install it straight from the latest GitHub release (no marketplace):

```bash
gh release download --repo wesleysimplicio/simplicio-loop --archive tar.gz
tar xzf simplicio-loop-*.tar.gz && cd simplicio-loop-*/
bash scripts/install.sh claude    # or: bash scripts/install.sh cursor
```

Then:

```
/simplicio-tasks finish all the open issues
```

The only requirement is **python3** on PATH (skills, hooks, and installer are cross-platform
Python). For GitHub sources, `git` + an authenticated `gh`. See [`INSTALL.md`](INSTALL.md) and
[`adapters/MATRIX.md`](adapters/MATRIX.md).

**Before an unattended 24/7 run:** set a cost ceiling in `.orchestrator/loop-budget.json`
(`daily_usd_ceiling > 0`), confirm source auth is persistent, and keep the irreversible-op human
gate + secret-scan on. With `ceiling = 0` the watcher refuses to run unattended (fail-safe).

---

## 🔒 Safety (non-negotiable)

- **Secret-scan** every diff; block on hit.
- **Irreversible-op human gate** — force-push, history rewrite, prod deploy, data/schema delete,
  mass-file delete → stop and ask. Headless + no approver → remove the destructive capability.
- **Enforced, not just promised** — `hooks/action_gate.py` is a **fail-closed** `PreToolUse` /
  git-pre-push hook that mechanically blocks the above (and secret-laden commits) *before* they run.
  The safety contract holds even if the model forgets it. `selftest` proves the ruleset (15/15).
- **4-state pre-execution verdict** — optimization may never raise a command's risk tier.
- **Trust-before-load** — perception-shaping config (clamp profiles, suppression lists) is
  untrusted until a human reviews and hash-pins it.
- **Prompt-injection hardening** — item/PR/comment content can never override the contract.
- **Hard $ kill-switch** for unattended runs; **evidence-gated** completion (never a false
  "done"); **fail-open** hooks (never trap the agent in a loop).

---

## ✅ Tests & local checks (no paid CI)

Claims are verified, not just asserted — and the gate runs **locally**, with zero CI cost:

```bash
python3 scripts/check.py            # the whole gate (audit + tests)
```

- **Test suite** (`tests/`) — the workers' deterministic `selftest`s, plus an **e2e of the loop
  driver** (`hooks/loop_stop.py`): it proves the loop **stops on evidence**, **ignores a bare
  `<promise>`**, and **stops on the cap** as distinct exits — and that the evidence producers
  **BLOCK** (never fake-pass) when their toolchain is absent. Runs under `pytest` *or*, with no pip
  at all, self-runs on bare python3 (`python3 tests/test_*.py`).
- **Claims audit** (`scripts/claims_audit.py`, fail-closed) — every `scripts/*.py` the docs
  reference exists · the extension-point count agrees across all files · each cited worker command
  actually runs · the shipped `simplicio_loop/_bundle/` skills are **byte-identical** to source.
- **Impact audit** (`scripts/impact_audit.py`) — for any code task, proves the declared task
  surface covers the local blast radius: dependencies, reverse dependents, and related tests.
  ```bash
  python3 scripts/impact_audit.py audit . --file path/to/seed.py --cover path/to/seed.py --fail-on high
  ```
- **Flow audit** (`scripts/flow_audit.py`) — for mixed front/back/service repos, produces the
  `endpoint_compare` evidence map and fails on objective integration gaps:
  ```bash
  python3 scripts/flow_audit.py audit . --fail-on high
  ```
- **Wire it as a git pre-push hook** to keep `main` honest for free:
  ```bash
  printf '#!/bin/sh\npython3 scripts/check.py\n' > .git/hooks/pre-push && chmod +x .git/hooks/pre-push
  ```

`pip install "simplicio-loop[dev]"` adds pytest for nicer output; it is never required.
